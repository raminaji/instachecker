1. look at instafollowers and instafollowing txt files
2. in instafollowers put ur followers
3. in instafollowing put ur following list
4. To  get each list do the following:
5. go to profile on desktop then click on your followers
6. scroll to the bottom of your list !!! THIS IS CRUCIAL because you have to load all of your followers in. you will know once you've loaded all of them as you can't scroll any further on the list
7. Now inspect element the first username so scroll back to the top
8. now try to locate the div which says "x9f619 xjbqb8w x78zum5 x168nmei x13lgxp2 x5pf9jr xo71vjh x1sxyh0 xurb0ha x1uhb9sk x6ikm8r x1rife3k x1iyjqo2 x2lwn1j xeuugli xdt5ytf xqjyukv x1qjc9v5 x1oa3qoh x1nhvcw1 x1l90r2v"
9. the div above looks similar to the user div, but you want to get the parent div so make sure when u hover over the html code, the entire box highlights and not just the one username.
10. if the one usernamei s highlgihted, then move ur cursor above to the next div above which starts with the pattern above until u find the div which highlights your entire list.
11. you can also check this by looking at the last pattern in the class. the right div ends in x1l90r2v while the wrong divs end in x1nhvcw1 even tho they all start the same way
12. now right click the div; click copy; then click entire element (u want to copy the entire element)
13. then paste into the text file
14. repeat for the following list
15. then run the code :)
